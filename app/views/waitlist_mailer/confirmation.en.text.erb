Thank you for joining the ScoreBase Pro waitlist.

You're among the first to hear about our AI-powered smart search for sheet music. Instead of hunting through catalogs with keywords, you'll soon be able to search the way you actually think:

  "I need a piano piece for my student who's been playing for 2 years,
   something romantic but not too difficult"

ScoreBase Pro understands musical context — difficulty levels, vocal ranges, instrumentation, duration, style, and mood. It searches our catalog of 300,000+ public domain scores to find exactly what you need.

When it launches: $2.99/month

We'll email you when ScoreBase Pro goes live. In the meantime, you can continue to browse and download from our free catalog at https://scorebase.org
