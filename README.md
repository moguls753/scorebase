# ScoreBase

A search engine for public domain music scores.

Aggregates scores from multiple sources:
- PDMX (MuseScore's public domain catalog)
- CPDL (Choral Public Domain Library)
- IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project)
- More to come

Normalizes composer names across sources, generates thumbnails, and provides filtering by key, time signature, genre, voicing, and more.
